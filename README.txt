The contest was organized as follows:

    Round 1
    -------
    Judges gave a simple yes/no for each submission. Submissions with majority
    (strictly greater than four) yes votes moved on to Round 2.

    Round 2
    -------
    Judges scored each entry according to

        Originality - 10 points.
            Is the submission interesting, does it exhibit a novel technique for
            hiding bugs, etc.?
        Effectiveness - 10 points.
            How much damage does the submission cause (e.g. complete key
            recovery would rank higher than leaking a few bytes of plaintext).
        Difficulty of Detection - 10 points.
            How hard would it be for someone to spot the backdoor? Consider both
            experts (e.g. during a formal code audit), and non-experts (e.g.
            a non-crypto-expert maintainer merging a pull requests on GitHub).
        Judge's Discretion - 5 points.
            Room for the judges to give bonus points to truly exceptional
            submissions.

            Rogdham 18.68 (missing 1)
            JacobThompson 16.93 (missing 1)

    Round 3
    -------
    The top-four scoring entries were brought into Round 3. The judges decided
    GaetanLeurent and JohnMeacham should be the winners, except in opposite
    order to their relative scores since JohnMeacham's submission has more
    practical implications.
